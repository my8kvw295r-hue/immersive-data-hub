# Skill Taxonomy for Immersive Creative Roles

## Overview

A structured, machine-readable taxonomy of skills relevant to immersive creative roles, especially Creative Directors for Immersive Media.

### Evidence Integrity Rule (mandatory)

### No-duplication Rule

Each skill in the taxonomy must be unique.  
Before adding a new skill, existing entries must be checked to avoid duplicates or trivial rephrasings.  
If something is already covered, the existing skill should be enriched rather than duplicated.


All evidence in this dataset must be:

- **real**
- **verifiable**
- **non-invented**
- **properly referenced**
- **checked before inclusion**

No fictional or hallucinated sources are allowed.  
Every skill must be supported by documented evidence.

## Base datasets and enrichment layer
