Investigations and donor reports highlight that local sewage systems and solid waste management have lagged far behind development, contributing to poor water quality in some coves and damage to coral reefs and seagrass meadows. Authorities have introduced temporary closures of specific beaches, caps on visitor numbers for island-hopping tours and new rules on mooring and waste disposal, but enforcement remains uneven and local residents worry about being priced out of coastal areas."

Recent reporting and National Park Service documents highlight a combination of record visitation, long entrance queues, overflowing parking lots at key geyser basins and wildlife jams that slow traffic for hours. Gateway communities benefit economically but also struggle with housing pressure and seasonal congestion. Rangers and planners are experimenting with timed-entry tests, shuttle systems and site-specific traffic management projects, yet staffing and funding remain limited relative to demand."

At the same time, climate variability, upstream water-use debates and periodic mass wildlife die-offs underline the system’s vulnerability. Community trusts benefit from tourism revenues but face internal tensions and uneven benefit sharing. Conservation reports highlight implementation gaps in the Okavango Delta Management Plan due to limited funding, weak enforcement and complex stakeholder interests."

Additional reporting links overtourism in Petra not only to crowding at the Siq and key monuments, but also to heavy reliance on working animals that carry visitors in extreme heat, contributing to animal-welfare concerns and reputational risks. Animal-protection groups document over 1,000 horses, donkeys and camels working long days on steep, eroding stairways and sandy tracks, often with limited access to shade, water and veterinary care. Local residents depend strongly on tourist spending in the site and in nearby Wadi Musa, which makes it politically difficult to sharply restrict flows without offering alternative livelihoods or mobility systems."

Recent reports portray parts of the northern Pantanal, especially around Porto Jofre, as hotspots where a single jaguar can attract dozens of tourist boats at once, with operators competing for the closest view. Conservationists warn that this intense pressure may alter jaguar behaviour and increase stress on other wildlife, while recurrent fires, droughts and land-use change continue to threaten the wider wetland ecosystem. Local communities and ranchers increasingly depend on wildlife tourism income, which creates both incentives for conservation and tensions around who controls access and benefits."

Additional reporting highlights a chronic mix of plastic waste, untreated or partly treated wastewater from tourist boats and nearby urban areas, heavy cruise and tour-boat traffic and rapid coastal real-estate development around Ha Long City. UNESCO and IUCN have repeatedly flagged that, without stricter planning and enforcement, these pressures could undermine the World Heritage values of the Ha Long Bay–Cat Ba property, even if it has not been formally placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Local residents and guides report growing dissatisfaction among visitors who encounter floating trash and murky water instead of the clear, iconic seascape promoted in tourism marketing."

Boracay is widely cited as a flagship case of overtourism leading to state-imposed closure. Before 2018, rapid and weakly regulated resort development overloaded sewage systems, with many establishments discharging untreated wastewater into coastal waters. The six-month shutdown ordered by the national government forced temporary job losses for tens of thousands of workers but also enabled a partial reset of infrastructure and zoning. Post-reopening, stricter building rules, caps on visitor numbers and a beach-easement policy were introduced, though questions remain about enforcement and long-term equity."
