Experiences included helicopter flights over Manhattan and resort scenes in sun destinations. The VR moment was deliberately integrated into the sales conversation: first an immersive taster, then a concrete travel offer. The campaign is widely cited as one of the first real-world tests of VR as a conversion tool in travel retail rather than just a gimmick.",

The suspended seating platform lifted riders in front of a large curved screen with synchronized motion and in-theatre effects as they helped defend an underwater civilization from a sea monster. The attraction operated as one of the park’s flagship media-based rides from its opening in March 2023 until Katmandu Park’s permanent closure in March 2024.",
