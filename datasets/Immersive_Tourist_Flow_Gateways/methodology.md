## Methodology for the Dataset

This methodology defines how projects are researched, validated, classified, and recorded for the dataset **Immersive_Tourist_Flow_Gateways**. The goal is to document immersive gateway systems that guide, redirect, modulate, or replace tourist flows using spatial storytelling, behavioural cues, and technological interventions. The approach is directly aligned with the framework described in the article on martin-sambauer.com about Origins of Wonder.

## 1. Scope

A project qualifies for inclusion if it uses immersive media or spatial interventions to:

* redirect or re-route tourist flows to alternative attractions or zones,
* shift tourist activity into different time windows or timeslots,
* replace the physical visit through immersive substitution experiences,
* influence behaviour before entering sensitive or high-impact areas,
* act as a functional gateway (airport, marina, visitor centre, mobility hub, digital twin),
* create emotional peaks away from fragile environments.

Included:

* immersive arrival experiences,
* visitor centres with immersive flow-management goals,
* dome theatres used as behavioural or routing tools,
* XR-based ecological or cultural behaviour-change experiences,
* virtual pre-visit layers designed to prime expectations and reduce impact.

Excluded:

* attractions without any influence on flow navigation,
* museums without gateway role,
* purely promotional installations without behavioural or structural intent.

## 2. Research Principles

### 2.1 Evidence Requirement

Each entry must be backed by at least one verifiable, non-AI source (masterplans, academic papers, government documents, operator announcements, reliable journalism).

### 2.2 Anti-Hallucination Rule

No assumptions or speculative values may be added. Unknown fields remain empty. Every recorded detail must be confirmable.

### 2.3 Timestamping

Each dataset entry includes:

* date_added (UTC),
* date_last_verified (UTC),
* source_last_checked.

These ensure transparency about the dataset’s freshness.

## 3. Taxonomy

### 3.1 Project Goal

* flow_redirection
* timeslot_shift
* behaviour_change
* physical_impact_replacement
* educational_priming
* conservation_support
* arrival_expectation_setting

### 3.2 Methods of Flow Navigation

* immersive substitution (virtual/dome replacing physical visit),
* emotional peak relocation (peak away from sensitive zones),
* content-driven routing (post-experience suggested paths),
* temporal redistribution (encouraging off-peak attendance),
* spatial storytelling as a navigation layer,
* behavioural narrative priming (instructions embedded in story arcs),
* gateway sequencing (multi-step immersive entry funnels).

### 3.3 Media Formats

* fulldome
* 360-degree projection
* virtual reality
* augmented reality
* mixed reality
* spatial audio environments
* digital twins and simulation chambers

### 3.4 Spatial Role

* airport_gateway
* marina_gateway
* urban_gateway
* ecological_gateway
* visitor_centre
* virtual_gateway

## 4. Data Fields

For each project, the dataset records:

* project_name
* country
* region
* gateway_type
* project_goal
* methods_used
* media_format
* implementation_stage (concept, planned, under construction, operating)
* producer / operating_entity
* director / lead_creator
* budget (if documented)
* visitor_capacity_per_hour
* annual_visitors (if available)
* duration_min
* sustainability_context (biodiversity, conservation, emissions)
* measurable_effects (if documented)
* measurement_methods_used
* effectiveness_studies_available (yes/no)
* reference_urls
* timestamp fields

## 5. Effectiveness Studies & Measurement

A core objective of the dataset is to understand the **real influence of immersive gateways on visitor behaviour**. Therefore the dataset documents:

### 5.1 Types of Measured Impact

* reduction of traffic to sensitive zones,
* increase in usage of alternative attractions,
* redistribution across timeslots,
* behavioural compliance rates (ecological or cultural),
* visitor awareness uplift scores,
* percentage of visitors choosing immersive substitution instead of physical presence.

### 5.2 Measurement Methods

* controlled studies with control groups,
* post-experience surveys,
* tracking of visitor routing changes,
* ecological impact monitoring,
* ticketing and timeslot data analysis,
* behavioural audits in protected zones.

### 5.3 Scientific Literature

The dataset includes references to:

* XR behaviour-change research,
* immersive conservation storytelling studies,
* overtourism mitigation literature,
* gateway-based flow engineering case studies.

## 6. Alignment with the Origins of Wonder Framework

The methodology follows the principles outlined in the article [“Origins of Wonder – An Immersive Impact Investment”](https://martin-sambauer.com/origins-of-wonder-an-immersive-impact-investment/):

* emotional peaks can be separated from fragile physical sites,
* immersive story environments can prime behaviour before arrival,
* gateways act as narrative and logistical filters,
* flow management blends ecology and audience experience,
* immersive storytelling can reduce physical pressure while increasing understanding.
